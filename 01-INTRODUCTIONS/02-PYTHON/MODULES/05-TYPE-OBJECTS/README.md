🧵 Module — Type Objects —(type, isinstance, id)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

✨ Overview
In Python, everything is an object — numbers, strings, booleans, functions, and even types themselves.
Understanding type objects helps explain:
how Python represents data internally
how variables relate to objects
how Python decides what operations are valid
how dynamic typing really works
This module focuses on the type() function, object identity, and safe 
type checking using isinstance(). These concepts are essential for 
writing robust, readable, and professional Python code.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 What I will learn in this module
By the end of this module, I will be able to:
Understand that variables reference objects, not values
Use type() to inspect the type of an object
Understand that types themselves are objects
Use isinstance() for safe type checking
Understand object identity using id()
Recognize the difference between:
value
type
identity
Avoid common beginner mistakes related to type checking
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Why type objects matter
Because Python is dynamically typed:
variable types are determined at runtime
the same variable can reference different object types
type-related bugs can appear if code is not defensive
Knowing how type objects work allows you to:
write safer functions
validate inputs correctly
debug unexpected behavior
understand error messages more deeply

🧩 Difficulty and ranking system
Tasks and examples are organized using the same ranking system as other modules:
Rank 1 — Beginner
Using type() and recognizing basic types.
Rank 2 — Easy
Comparing types and understanding variable reassignment.
Rank 3 — Intermediate
