🧵 Module — Control Flow — if / elif / else in python 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✨ Overview
The if / elif / else structure is the foundation of decision-making in Python.
It allows a program to choose different execution paths based on conditions.
This construct is used everywhere:
Validating user input
Controlling program logic
Handling business rules
Managing permissions and states
Reacting to real-time data
Understanding conditional logic clearly is essential for writing correct, readable, and maintainable Python code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎯 Learning Objectives
By studying this section, I will be able to:
Use if, elif, and else to control execution flow
Write clear boolean expressions
Combine conditions using logical operators
Avoid common conditional mistakes
Structure readable decision trees
Apply best practices for clean conditional logic
🧠 Concept: How Python Evaluates Conditions
Python evaluates conditions top to bottom:
The if condition is checked first
If it is True, its block runs and the rest are skipped
If False, Python checks each elif
If none match, the else block runs (if present)
Only one branch executes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
🔹 Basic Syntax
if condition:
    # code runs if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # runs if previous conditions were False
else:
    # runs if all conditions were False
🔢 Comparison Operators
Used to compare values:
Operator	Meaning
==	equal to
!=	not equal to
<	less than
>	greater than
<=	less than or equal
>=	greater than or equal
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example:
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
🔗 Logical Operators
Used to combine conditions:
Operator	Meaning
and	all conditions must be True
or	at least one condition is True
not	negates the condition
Example:
age = 25
has_id = True
if age >= 18 and has_id:
    print("Access granted")
---------------------------------------------------------------------
🧩 Using elif Effectively
Use elif to avoid deeply nested if statements.
❌ Less readable:
if score >= 90:
    print("A")
else:
    if score >= 80:
        print("B")
✅ Better:
if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")
else:
    print("C")
⚠️ Common Mistakes
❌ Using assignment instead of comparison
if x = 5:   # ERROR
❌ Overusing else
Sometimes no else is needed.
if value < 0:
    print("Negative")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Best Practices
✔ Keep conditions simple and readable
✔ Avoid deeply nested if blocks
✔ Use meaningful variable names
✔ Prefer elif over nested if
✔ Use early returns inside functions
✔ Write conditions that express intent clearly
